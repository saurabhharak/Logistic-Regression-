# Logistic-Regression-
I developed a logistic regression model in Python that takes various inputs such as age, gender, passenger class, and other factors to determine the likelihood of survival. To understand the columns are significant, I used various graphs to demonstrate data. I choose the column and train the model based on its success or value. The model's accuracy is 77 percent.
