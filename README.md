# Logistic-Regression-
In Python, I created a logistic regression model that considers age, gender, passenger status, and other variables to decide the probability of survival. To help people understand why the columns are relevant, I used different graphs to illustrate results. I choose the column and train the model on its performance or value. The accuracy of the model is 77%.
